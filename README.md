1. Motto behind the project is to check the efficiency of STP and to forecast the inflow of
wastewater so that in near future due to an increase in population the STPs may get
overloaded with wastewater and PMC might have to install more STPs or increase the
capacities of currently working treatment plants.

2. The treated water is analyzed in the lab before it is discharged in the river for the
parameters like pH, TSS, COD, and BOD which have a standard set of values. For these
values, we are testing a hypothesis for all parameters so that we can conclude whether
the treated water is reusable or not. Lastly, we are doing model fitting in which we are
searching for the best fitting model using which we can classify reusability for given
data

This research paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the efficiency of a sewage treatment plant using data science techniques. The findings underscore the significance of data-driven approaches in identifying operational inefficiencies and optimizing plant performance. The results emphasize the need for continuous monitoring, data collection, and analysis to ensure the long-term sustainability of sewage treatment facilities. By embracing data science methodologies, stakeholders can enhance the effectiveness of sewage treatment plants and contribute to a cleaner and healthier environment.
